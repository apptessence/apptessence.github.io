                    <h2>An Incubator for the Digitally Disenfranchised</h2>
                    <p>Our long term project is to create a pathway to digital enfranchisement. We're learning from partners and exemplars in South East Asia how to use tech education in entirely new ways.</p>

                <h4>Workshops</h4>
                <p>Our objective is to identity, incubate, and launch digitally tools that serve great ideas that emerge from village ,  rural, and urban poor conditions. To do that, we offer a process that starts with workshops. </p>
                <p>Our workshops are offered jointly with NGOs, academic organizations, research and corporate partners. In each workshop, ideas are vetted, developed, and initial proposals are generated, with a clear identification of a few crucial requirements. </p>
                <p>Those include need, demographics and market, technology. Most importantly, we require a team profile â€“ although we don't expect each candidate to have a full team, we want a picture of who will be needed to contribute to the success of the idea.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-4 ">
                <div class="section-icon">
                    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/incubate/bootcamp.png">
                </div>
                <h4>Bootcamp</h4>
                <p>We start the bootcamp phase by selecting the most promising proposals from the Workshop phase. </p>
                <p>We believe that it's easier for someone with an understanding of the village or rural socioeconomics that their idea will operate within to understand how technology can be shaped, that it is for development teams from outside those environments to understand the village.</p>
                <p>So we bring one or more members of teams we think have a great proposal into a two-month bootcamp, where we teach tech skills in coding. Our goal isn't to make a coder: we see programming as an analytical tool. Once you understand how it works, you're empowered to shape technology to your business idea, instead of the other way round.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xl-4 ">
                <div class="section-icon  left-icon">
                    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/incubate/mvp.png">
                </div>
                <h4>Prototype/MVP</h4>
                <p>Again, the most promising ideas that made it to the bootcamp phase are assessed. Using their new analytic skills, bootcamp participants draw up a detailed technical plan, based on what they've learned, and their business ideas</p>
                <p>We select from among these plans for the best, most validatable project. Then in two phases we provide a full development team to produce a digital prototype. Each team takes their prototype to the field, and further validates what they've built in the environment and with the users they are aiming to serve.</p>
                <p>The very best of these prototypes, with the most promising field results are then further provisioned, with blockchain, business, UI, finance, HCD and other expertise, to produce a final MVP.</p>
