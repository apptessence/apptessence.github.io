                    <p>A primary impediment to transactions of all kinds, from commercial to educational, logistics to health care is a lack of established identity.</p>

                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Tech education and identity are connected. Leading the way in educational disciplines, technology, especially coding, has always demanded ongoing committment to learning. New languages, frameworks, libraries and concepts constantly flow into the IT world.</p>
                    <p>What you learn, and how you learn it form an identity. Thirty years ago, most education was a sequence leading to a degree. Now, an ongoing, life long demand for new skills has been met my a diversity of new forms of educational experiences.</p>

                        <span>Digital Identity based on blockchain is central to our project</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>That ever-expanding series of experiences is your educational identity, and our goal as education facilitators is to strengthen that identity</p>
                    <p>At the same time, the demand has never been greater that now for a formal system to aggregate authenticated educational experiences. Everything you do, from a 5 year degree to 5 minute YouTube video watched, in principle adds to that identity, and should be available to others, whether employers, business partners, financiers, or further stages in your education. But right now, the landscape is dotted with disparate, unconnected experiences for each person. And the situation is worsening.</p>
                    <p>So that's why we work with partners like Namachain, who are building the foundations for new, more robust, more secure forms of identity, including educational identity. </p>
                    <h3>Digital Incubator</h3>
                    <p>In our incubator projects, we also work with these partners, whose blockchain-based services provide security, granularity and user control of access. As we workshop projects that involve village economies, lack of formal idetity is often a primary impediment to building useful services that can bring security and prosperiity. This is particularly true among women, who as a group are the most likely to have formal identification; to have banking histories; to have educational identities. Building projects that focus on creating and reinforcing identity, while emphasizing interoperability with other services is a crucial part of building a digital culture of inclusion and equality.</p>
